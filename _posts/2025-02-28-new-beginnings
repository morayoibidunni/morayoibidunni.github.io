The Cambridge Dictionary describes the word 'new' as recently created or having started to exist recently. Synonyms include words such as ‘novel’, ‘innovative’ and even ‘brand new’. To be completely honest, almost nothing I do or say here is going to be that; and I say this for a few reasons.

Firstly, I don’t fully subscribe to the idea that anything is truly new. By this i mean everything (or almost everything) is derived of something else which pre-dated or pre-existed it. I think this happens in all aspects of life kind of similar to the theory that energy is neither created nor destroyed; only transformed from one thing to another. This means that anything coming to be is a product -wether directly or indirectly- of something that already was. This is just my belief anyway.

Another reason I don’t necessarily feel this blog is new is perhaps more innately because of self doubt and an inability to trust the product of my own doing. At the moment as i write this its a friday evening an im truly struggling to even figure out how to formulate and structure my thoughts. This is usually the case and I’ve yet to decide if its because of the ADHD (diagnosed, but I haven’t fully accepted/chosen to believe— topic for another day), the fact that i have been scared to write for well over a year now— another topic for potential exploration; or perhaps its literally just friday AND all of the above!

I planned to go off Substack teams kind prompts for this but seem to be all over the place. The truth is I don’t fully know what it is i want to say. I have thoughts— most of the time, too many to fully grasp. and being so curious about so many different things I tend to want to try lots of things and sort of find myself along the way. So actually maybe thats part of what this will be. Again i dont subscribe to the notion of newness so i wont promise anything novel or particularly enlightening. More so keeping this space open as an avenue for exploration of my thoughts, feelings, likes and dislikes.

If you’ve made it this far- ARE YOU OKAY?

No genuinely, are you? I hope not. Because then maybe I wont be so hard on myself trying to form each of these letters into my magnum opus. Maybe I’ll be content just having this for the mere space to express myself and share and …get joy? I don’t know. Let’s see.

So Welcome I guess… to a thing born from lots of other things.
